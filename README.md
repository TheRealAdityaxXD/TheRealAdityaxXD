## 🚀 About Me

I’m a Computer Engineering student who enjoys blending creativity with technology. From developing web applications and Discord bots to scripting multiplayer game systems in SA-MP, I love building projects that solve real problems.  

I actively explore **full-stack development, UI/UX design, automation tools, and game scripting**. My goal is to become a versatile software engineer who can design, develop, and deploy complete systems.

✨ Fun fact: I enjoy working on both backend logic and front-end design — I believe great software should *work perfectly and look beautiful.*
