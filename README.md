## 🚀 About Me

I’m a Computer Engineering student who enjoys blending creativity with technology. From developing web applications and Discord bots to scripting advanced multiplayer systems in SA-MP and MTA, I love building projects that solve real problems.  

I actively explore **full-stack development, game scripting, automation tools, and UI/UX design**. My goal is to become a versatile software engineer capable of designing and deploying complete, scalable systems.

✨ Fun fact: I enjoy working on both backend logic and front-end design — great software should *work perfectly and look beautiful.*
