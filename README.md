## 🚀 About Me

I’m a Computer Engineering student who enjoys blending creativity with technology. I specialize in developing advanced multiplayer systems for SA-MP and MTA servers, along with designing clean and engaging user interfaces.  

I actively explore game scripting, backend systems, database integration, and UI/UX design. My goal is to become a highly skilled game systems developer capable of building scalable and optimized multiplayer frameworks.

✨ Fun fact: I enjoy working on both backend logic and visual design — great systems should be powerful and well-designed.
